# Cloud Backends & Mirroring

> Part of the [Écluse architecture overview](../architecture.md).

## Mirror Queue

Mirroring is **demand-driven**: when a client pulls an *artifact* whose version
passes the rules (the tarball path on a private-upstream miss), the proxy:

1. Enqueues a mirror job (the mirror target URL, package name, version, and
   artifact location) to the configured **mirror queue**.
2. Returns the artifact to the client **immediately** — no blocking on mirror
   completion.

Metadata (packument) requests filter but do **not** mirror — only versions a
client actually fetches are mirrored, rather than every admitted version of every
package anyone browses.

The queue is a cloud-agnostic seam with backends for AWS SQS and GCP Pub/Sub
(see [Cloud Backends](#cloud-backends)). A consumer (a separate worker process)
receives jobs, fetches the artifact from the public upstream, **verifies its bytes
against the version's integrity hash** (npm `dist.integrity`), publishes it to the
mirror target via `publishArtifact`, and acknowledges the job. A hash mismatch
fails the job (no publish — it routes to retry/DLQ) and alarms, so a corrupt or
tampered artifact never enters the private upstream, which is later served without
rules. The worker thus
touches both cloud seams — [`MirrorQueue`](#queue-abstraction) to receive and
[`CredentialProvider`](#credential-provider) to authenticate the write — while the
publish itself is **plain npm protocol plus a bearer token**: pushing to a managed
registry is no different from pushing to any npm registry, so there is no
per-cloud publish path. Both backends give at-least-once delivery with retry and a
dead-letter path for jobs that keep failing — the semantics the worker needs,
regardless of cloud. At-least-once is safe here because **publishing is idempotent**: registries treat
versions as immutable, so a redelivered job's publish finds the version already
present and is treated as success. The worker does **not** re-run the rules — the
artifact was gated at serve time when the job was enqueued; the enqueue→process
window is too short for meaningful policy drift, and anything mirrored is in any
case later served without rules.

This means there is a window between a package being approved and it appearing
in the private upstream. Subsequent requests for the same package during this
window will fall through to the public upstream again and re-run rules — this is
acceptable; the rules are deterministic for a given package version.

### Process model

At launch the worker runs **in the proxy process as a supervised concurrent
thread** (`async` / `unliftio`), not a separate service: worker load is
front-loaded — a cold mirror back-fills heavily for the first few days — then
settles to a modest steady state, so an extra deployable is not yet worth it.
Transient failures are handled in the loop (retry/backoff/DLQ, above); a sustained
failure surfaces through the worker's health signal.

The split is kept **trivial for later**. The server and worker are each a
self-contained entry function over the shared, seam-based `Env` —
`runServer :: Env -> IO ()` and `runWorker :: Env -> IO ()` — and the
single-process `Main` simply runs both concurrently. Splitting into two binaries
is then two thin `Main`s calling the same functions, no rearchitecting, because
neither depends on the other — only on the seams in `Env`. The worker carries its
**own health/liveness surface** (a consume-loop heartbeat / last-successful-poll),
distinct from the server's HTTP readiness, so that the single process's health
reflects a stalled worker today and a future standalone worker binary has its own
liveness/readiness probe.

## Cloud Backends

Écluse couples to a cloud provider in exactly **two seams**, both records of
functions (the Handle pattern — see [Seams](#seams-records-of-functions)) so that
a provider is an additive backend rather than a structural change, the same
posture as [`RegistryClient`](registry-model.md#registry-abstraction):

1. **`MirrorQueue`** — the durable hand-off from the request path to the mirror
   worker (see [Mirror Queue](#mirror-queue)).
2. **`CredentialProvider`** — mints the short-lived bearer token for any registry
   endpoint (private upstream or mirror target) that is a cloud-managed registry
   rather than a static-credential one (see
   [Credential Provider](#credential-provider)).

These two are the **cloud axis**. The **ecosystem axis** is
[`RegistryClient`](registry-model.md#registry-abstraction), which is
cloud-agnostic — so the npm protocol/data plane, **including publish**, is written
once and reused across every cloud (a managed registry is just an npm endpoint
plus a token; there is no per-cloud publish path and no object-store seam).
Everything else — the proxy core, rules engine, web layer, CVE subsystem — is
cloud-agnostic too. **AWS and GCP are both first-class targets**; the design
admits a third provider by adding backends behind these two seams.

### Seams: records of functions

Every seam — `RegistryClient`, `MirrorQueue`, `CredentialProvider` — is a
**record whose fields are functions** (the *Handle pattern*), constructed by a
per-backend smart constructor (`newSqsQueue :: SqsConfig -> IO MirrorQueue`). This
is Haskell's idiomatic equivalent of an interface with swappable implementations:
the record type is the interface, a smart constructor is a concrete
implementation, and the closure it returns captures that backend's private state
(an `amazonka` env, an HTTP manager) exactly as an object's fields would.

Backend choice is **runtime, config-driven, single-binary**: all adapters are
compiled in, and one **composition root** reads the configured provider, calls the
matching smart constructor, and stores the resulting record in `Env`. Nothing
downstream knows which backend it holds — it just applies the field. This keeps
the cloud SDKs' selection in one place rather than smeared across the code, and
leaves the door open to split adapters into separate libraries later without
disturbing the seam.

*Alternatives considered.* A **free monad** (operations reified as data, AWS/GCP
as interpreters) and **tagless-final** both abstract the backend too, but they buy
*program-as-data* / compile-time dispatch we do not need: selection here is at
runtime by config, the per-op work lives in the interpreter either way, and both
would mean a heavier dependency than the `ReaderT Env IO` baseline. Records of
functions give the same swappability and trivial test doubles (an in-memory
record) with none of that. The free monad would earn its keep only if we needed to
inspect/rewrite mirror programs (e.g. batch enqueues) — and that has a contained
answer behind the existing seam if it ever arises.

### Service mapping

| Concern | AWS | GCP |
|---------|-----|-----|
| Mirror queue | SQS | Cloud Pub/Sub |
| Managed npm registry | CodeArtifact | Artifact Registry |
| Workload identity / token source | STS / instance role | Workload Identity / ADC |
| Local emulator (tests) | `ministack` (LocalStack-style) | Google's official Pub/Sub emulator |

Both managed registries speak the **npm protocol over HTTPS** and differ only in
how the bearer token is obtained and refreshed, so they sit behind the
[`CredentialProvider`](#credential-provider) seam while the `RegistryClient`
protocol/data plane (`http-client`) is identical across them (see
[Web Layer](web-layer.md#web-layer)).

### Credential Provider

Outbound auth (proxy → registry) is its own seam, separate from
[`RegistryClient`](registry-model.md#registry-abstraction). A `CredentialProvider`
yields the current bearer token for a registry endpoint, refreshing it before
expiry:

```haskell
newtype CredentialProvider = CredentialProvider
  { currentToken :: IO AuthToken }            -- refreshes-before-expiry internally

data AuthToken = AuthToken { secret :: Secret, expiresAt :: Maybe UTCTime }
```

A provider attaches **per registry endpoint**, not globally: the three-registry
tuple (private upstream, public upstream, mirror target) may need up to three,
though they commonly collapse — the private upstream and mirror target are often
the same CodeArtifact repo behind one provider, and the public upstream is usually
anonymous.

**The sub-seam that matters.** The interesting logic is the refresh / cache /
expiry / concurrency policy, *not* the cloud call. So a single generic wrapper
holds that policy, parameterised over a tiny per-cloud `mintToken` leaf:

```
CredentialProvider
  └─ generic refresh/cache wrapper      -- deterministic: injected clock + fake mint
       └─ mintToken :: IO AuthToken     -- the only per-cloud, un-emulable part
```

Adapters supply only the leaf: `static` (a fixed token, no expiry), **CodeArtifact**
(`GetAuthorizationToken` via `amazonka`, TTL up to 12h), **ADC** (an OAuth2 access
token, TTL ~1h). The wide TTL spread is exactly why the wrapper refreshes off the
token's own `expiresAt` rather than a fixed interval — the same policy then fits
either cloud, and each cloud contributes ~10 lines. This isolation also bounds the
test gap (see [Testing](#testing)): everything but `mintToken` is unit-testable.

### Queue abstraction

The queue is the one piece with materially different APIs per cloud, so it is its
own seam — a `MirrorQueue` with `enqueue` / `receive` / `ack` operations. SQS
(`SendMessage` / `ReceiveMessage` + visibility timeout / `DeleteMessage`) and
Pub/Sub (`Publish` / `Pull` + ack deadline / `Acknowledge`) both fit this
receive → process → ack shape; the differences (visibility timeout vs ack
deadline, dead-letter configuration) stay behind the seam. The provider is chosen
by configuration (see [Configuration](configuration.md#configuration)).

### Haskell client maturity — a design risk to retire early

This is the one place GCP is **not** a free addition. `amazonka` is comprehensive
and well-maintained; the GCP side is weaker, and the design names that risk
rather than assuming it away:

- **`gogol`** (the amazonka-equivalent GCP SDK, by the same author) covers
  Pub/Sub but has historically trailed `amazonka` in coverage and release
  cadence — its current state must be verified before it is relied on.
- `gogol` is **REST/JSON**-generated, whereas the official Pub/Sub **emulator is
  gRPC-first**, so "does our chosen client work against the emulator?" is not a
  given. Native Haskell gRPC (`grpc-haskell`) is itself immature and is avoided.
- The hedge that fits our philosophy — adopt for big infrastructure, hand-roll
  the small domain surface (see [Web Layer](web-layer.md#web-layer)) — is a thin
  REST client: Pub/Sub's `publish` / `pull` / `acknowledge` is a handful of
  JSON-over-HTTPS calls, and we already run `http-client` + `aeson` + a
  bearer-token pattern. A small client behind the `MirrorQueue` seam keeps us off
  a possibly-stale SDK, **provided** the emulator serves those REST calls.

**Design requirement.** GCP is *designed for* from day one (the two seams above),
but shipping it is **gated on a de-risking spike**: stand up the Pub/Sub emulator
via `testcontainers` and prove one client path can `publish → pull → ack` against
it. That single experiment resolves both the client-maturity and
emulator-compatibility questions before GCP is committed to a release. AWS
(`amazonka` + `ministack`) carries no such risk and ships first.

### Testing

`testcontainers` is a generic container manager, not an AWS-specific one — it
runs `ministack` today and the Pub/Sub emulator the same way. Each cloud's queue
backend is exercised in the integration tier against its own emulator (no real
cloud account or credentials; the Pub/Sub emulator ignores auth entirely), so the
`MirrorQueue` seam is verified per provider.

The managed-registry backends need no emulator — neither CodeArtifact nor
Artifact Registry has a usable one — and the seam split is what makes that a
non-problem. The npm **protocol** is just HTTPS+JSON, so it is exercised **once**
against a real npm-speaking registry (e.g. Verdaccio) or an in-process WAI stub,
and that single suite covers every managed registry because they share the
protocol. The only genuinely un-emulable surface is the per-cloud token *mint*,
isolated in the [`CredentialProvider`](#credential-provider)'s `mintToken` leaf:
the refresh/cache/expiry policy around it is unit-tested deterministically with an
injected clock and a fake mint, and the real cloud mint runs end-to-end only in
the (non-gating) smoke tier. The split shrinks the un-testable surface to one
small function per cloud — an explicit, accepted residual risk, consistent with
how `ecluse-smoke` is already treated.
