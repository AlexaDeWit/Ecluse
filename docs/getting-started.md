# Getting Started

Everything you need to set up a development environment and run the inner loop. For the
contribution *process* (conventions, sign-off, AI policy), see
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../CONTRIBUTING.md); for the test tiers and coverage, see
[Testing Strategy](testing.md).

## Local development

**Nix (with flakes) is a hard dependency.** The whole toolchain (GHC 9.10, Cabal, fourmolu,
hlint, Semgrep) comes from the dev shell, pinned by `flake.lock`; there's no supported
system-level build. Enter the shell with `nix develop` (or let `direnv` do it), then run
everything through **`make`**, the single entry point shared by local development and CI.

Run `make` **inside** the dev shell. The targets also work from a bare terminal (each one
wraps itself in `nix develop --command`), but that re-enters the shell per target, so keep it
for one-offs.

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Build | `make build` |
| Test (fast loop) | `make test` |
| Format (write) | `make format` |
| Lint | `make lint` |
| Static analysis (SAST) | `make sast` |
| Coverage (combined, matches Codecov; needs Docker) | `make coverage` |
| Coverage (fast, unit-only, Docker-free; partial) | `make coverage-unit` |
| Pre-push checks (fast) | `make check` |
| Full CI-gate mirror (needs Docker) | `make gate` |

Run `make help` for the full list (the integration/smoke suites, `nix-build`, `nix-check`,
…). The underlying commands live in the [`Makefile`](../Makefile), so local and CI never
drift.

**Before you push,** run `make check`, and it has to be clean: build (warnings are errors via
`-Werror`; see [`STYLE.md`](../STYLE.md) → "Compiler flags"), the unit suite, the doctest
examples, `fourmolu --mode check`, `hlint`, and Semgrep (zero findings). `make check` is the
fast subset; `make gate` additionally runs the Docker-bound integration suite and the Haddock
build, the two tiers the gate has that `make check` doesn't, for a faithful end-to-end
reproduction. (The only gate input neither runs is the Codecov upload, which is computed
server-side.) Add `make test-integration` (needs Docker) for the other gating suite. The CI
`gate` enforces the same set, so a clean local run predicts a green gate. The smoke suite
(`make test-smoke`) is allowed to fail and never gates (see [Testing Strategy](testing.md)).

### Reproducible build & checks (Nix)

The `make build` / `make test` targets above wrap `cabal`, the incremental inner loop. For a
reproducible, **hermetic** build and check run (sandboxed, with every dependency pinned by
`flake.lock`), use the Nix outputs (also exposed as make targets):

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Build the `ecluse` binary | `make nix-build` (`nix build`) → `./result/bin/ecluse` |
| Run the hermetic checks | `make nix-check` (`nix flake check`) |

`nix flake check` builds the package and runs the pure tier: the `ecluse-unit` suite
(`checks.unit`), `fourmolu --mode check` (`checks.format`), `hlint` (`checks.lint`),
`cabal check` (`checks.cabal-check`), and the library Haddock (`checks.docs`). Three things
are deliberately **excluded**, because they can't run in a hermetic sandbox: `ecluse-integration`
(needs a Docker daemon), `ecluse-smoke` (live network), and Semgrep (`--config auto` fetches
rules over the network). Those stay dev-shell / CI steps.

> **Flakes only see git-tracked files.** `git add` new sources before `nix build` /
> `nix flake check`, or they're invisible to the build, and a build that references them
> (e.g. via the cabal file) will fail on the missing modules.

Reach for Nix to reproduce CI exactly or to produce the release artifact; reach for `cabal`
for day-to-day iteration (Nix rebuilds the whole package on any change, so it's poor for
edit-compile cycles).

### Dependency locking

Two build paths means two locks, one per resolver, pinned **independently**:

| Path | Resolver | Lock |
|------|----------|------|
| Nix / hermetic build (the **shipped** artifact) | nixpkgs GHC 9.10 set | `flake.lock` |
| `cabal` (dev shell + the CI gate) | Hackage | `index-state:` in `cabal.project` + `cabal.project.freeze` |

`callCabal2nix` does **not** read `cabal.project` / `cabal.project.freeze`, so the two are
genuinely separate locks. The `index-state` caps the Hackage snapshot the solver may see, and
the freeze pins exact versions, so `cabal build` / `cabal test` (and therefore the gate)
resolve a **reproducible** plan: a fresh Hackage upload can no longer flip the gate with no
source change. Today's caret bounds keep the frozen versions close to the nixpkgs ones, so
the gate tests roughly what ships.

Move the pins **deliberately**:

- **cabal path.** `make freeze` advances `index-state` to the latest index and rewrites
  `cabal.project.freeze`. Commit both. (Renovate widens the *bounds* in `ecluse.cabal`;
  moving the *pinned versions* is this manual, reviewed step.)
- **Nix path.** `nix flake update`, or Renovate's weekly `flake.lock` refresh.

A flake bump that shifts the nixpkgs package set is a good prompt to `make freeze`, so both
paths keep tracking the same versions.

## Codebase Layout

The *principles* of module organization and namespacing (vertical organization, where types
live with their functions, one `Ecluse.<Area>` namespace per area, and when a `.Types` split
is justified) live in [`STYLE.md`](../STYLE.md) → "Module organization". This section records
the *current* concrete layout and the one project-specific pattern below.

- **Handles are records of functions, selected at one composition root.** A swappable backend
  (registry protocol, mirror queue, credential provider) is modelled as a record whose fields
  are functions (the *Handle pattern*), built by a per-backend smart constructor (e.g.
  `newSqsQueue :: SqsConfig -> IO MirrorQueue`). Adding a backend means adding a constructor
  behind the *existing* record and wiring it into the single, config-driven composition root,
  never smearing SDK or provider selection across call sites. See
  [Cloud Backends → Handles](architecture/cloud-backends.md#handles-records-of-functions).

For the **current module list**, read the module index of the
[published Haddock](https://alexadewit.github.io/Ecluse/api/) (each module's one-line summary
is its header) and the root [`Ecluse`](../src/Ecluse.hs) module's "How the code is organized"
synopsis for the narrative grouping. Both live with the code and update with it, so they can't
drift; this guide deliberately doesn't duplicate the list here.

Tests mirror this hierarchy within each suite's source dir (e.g. the unit specs for
`Ecluse.Rules` and `Ecluse.Version` are `test/unit/Ecluse/RulesSpec.hs` and
`test/unit/Ecluse/VersionSpec.hs`; version ordering additionally has a differential suite,
`Ecluse.VersionOrderingSpec`, against reference oracles).
